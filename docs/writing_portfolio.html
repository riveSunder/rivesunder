<h2>General Audience Science Writing</h2>

<ul>
  <li> What's Developmental Biology got to do with Machine Learning? (2021 July). <a href="https://macromoltek.medium.com/whats-developmental-biology-got-to-do-with-machine-learning-8b00aee0afdc">Orginal link</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riveSunder/rivesunder/refs/heads/master/assets/fulltexts/devobio_ml.pdf?raw=true">pdf</a>.</li>

  <blockquote>
  "A single cell can exhibit decision making and learning, and when groups of cells cooperate the result is all the beauty and diversity of multicellular life. Cells that form part of a larger organism have to figure out where to go, what to do, and what to become, and they do so with no top-down controller. Instead, individual cells communicate with their neighbors and make decisions that, accumulated over time, define and accomplish the goals of a larger organism."
  </blockquote>

  <li>What if they had put off the LIGO upgrades? (2017 August) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171204124420/https://www.thescinder.com/2017/08/13/what-if-they-had-put-off-the-ligo-upgrades/">Archived link</a>. <a href="https://thescinder.wordpress.com/2017/08/13/what-if-they-had-put-off-the-ligo-upgrades/">Original link</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riveSunder/rivesunder/refs/heads/master/assets/fulltexts/aligo_upgrade.pdf?raw=true">pdf</a>.</li>

  <blockquote>
  "For a 50/50 split in the odds of making a detection, we would have to wait 44 years [without advanced LIGO upgrades]. Chances are, funding bodies could very well lose interest in that time, and we certainly would not have seen the international enthusiasm in gravitational wave research resulting from the GW150914 announcement."
  </blockquote>

  <li>Radiation pressure strikes again! (October 2016) <a href="https://issuu.com/phoqus/docs/phoqus_newsletter3">Original link</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riveSunder/rivesunder/refs/heads/master/assets/fulltexts/radiation_pressure.pdf?raw=true">pdf</a>.</li>

  <blockquote>
  "Optical tweezers don't need to be so sensitive as to detect a fluttering in spacetime, but calibration and [] signal processing workflow is just as important for biophysics experiments with optical tweezers as for their larger cousins, the gravitational wave detectors."
  </blockquote>

  <li>The structure behind the simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9. (2015 December). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220701005039/https://www.thescinder.com/2015/12/23/the-structure-behind-the-simplicity-of-crisprcas9/">Archived link</a>. <a href="https://thescinder.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/the-structure-behind-the-simplicity-of-crisprcas9/">Original</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riveSunder/rivesunder/refs/heads/master/assets/fulltexts/cas9_simplicity.pdf?raw=true">pdf</a>.</li>

  <blockquote>
  "The same Cas9 protein, combined with different gRNA strands, can target different locations on a genome. Targeting a DNA sequence with an RNA sequence is simple. RNA and DNA are both chains of nucleotides, and the rules for binding are the same as for reading out or copying DNA: A binds with T or U, and C binds with G (and vice-versa). Targeting a DNA sequence with protein motifs is much more complicated. [...] This has consequences in the initial design of the gRNA as well as the efficacy of the system and the overall success rate. [T]he comparative ease-of-application stems from the differences in protein engineering vs. sequence design. Protein engineering is hard, but designing a gRNA sequence is easy."
  </blockquote>

  <li>To Space and Back with Biophotonics (2015 October). <a href="https://issuu.com/phoqus/docs/phoqus_newsletter1">Original</a>. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riveSunder/rivesunder/refs/heads/master/assets/fulltexts/sail_tweezers.pdf?raw=true">pdf</a>.</li>

  <blockquote>
  "It is not typically necessary to brace ourselves against a strong gust of sunshine at the macroscopic scale of humans: we have more pressing forces to worry about. However, at the level of proteins and cells the magnitudes of forces driving the essential activities of life are within the range of forces we can impart by redirecting a bit of laser light."
