### Recent Activity

* I'm very proud to have been part of the intern project completed by `tanishagerg` on modeling plant pattern formation using neural cellular automata: **[https://tanishagerg.github.io/SRNCA/pages/blogpost.html](https://tanishagerg.github.io/SRNCA/pages/blogpost.html)**

* In 2022 I developed **[Your Universal Cellular Automata](https://github.com/rivesunder/yuca)**, a research library for working with continuous cellular automata. `yuca` powered 3 publications during my work at the University of Vermont, and a current research project examining the role of systematic simulation error in self-organizing systems: [https://rivesunder.github.io/DisContinuous](https://rivesunder.github.io/DisContinuous)

* After finishing experiments on DisContinuous I plan on devoting significant attention to my embryonic graph and transformer-based deep learning library [Sepia](https://github.com/Cogibra/Sepia), with an interest in applications to biological sequences and systems and symbolic regression. 

* **[OpenSafety](https://github.com/rivesunder/opensafety)** (2020 and 2021) I built OpenSafety as an accesbile reinforcement learning gym for experimenting with the safety-focused control problems, oringally as an open-source alternative to OpenAI's MuJoCo-dependent [Safety Gym](https://github.com/openai/safety-gym). OpenSafety includes 11 environments/tasks, each with a safety constraint and multiple levels of difficulty.

* **[CARLE](https://github.com/rivesunder/carles)** and [CARLE's Game](https://github.com/rivesunder/carles_game) is a fast (up to ~100,000 64 by 64 cell grid updates per second) Life-like cellular automata simulator, and a challenge in open-ended RL and reward shaping (presented at the 2020 IEEE Conference on Games).

* **[BevoDevo](https://github.com/rivesunder/bevodevo)** is my library for evolutionary and development learning algorithms applied to reinforcement learning-structure problems.
