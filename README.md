RiveSunder here. I'm an interdisciplinary scientist broadly interested in exploring what it means to be an intelligent agent in this universe (and maybe a few others). My day job is machine learning for computational drug design, and before that I worked on inverse problem solving and deep learning for optical microscopy at a super-resolution startup called [Oxford Nanoimaing](https://oni.bio), in the dynamic optics and photonics lab at [Oxford University](http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/dop), at the University of Dundee, and a few months at T√ºbingen Universit√§t working with [optical tweezers](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/zentren/zentrum-fuer-molekularbiologie-der-pflanzen/research/cellular-nanoscience/) and [light sheet microscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.174102v1). 

I like to think that there is a long tradition of microscope builders later making interesting discoveries in artificial intelligence. And by a long tradition I am referring to Marvin Minsky's invention of the [confocal microscope](https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/ConfocalMemoir.html) to very little fanfare in the 1950s. In my opinion, key areas to explore so that we might get artificial intelligence right include complexity, developmental biology, and evolution.

#### [Carle's Game](https:/github.com/rivesunder/carles_game)

* I've been putting a fair amount of work into a contest in open-ended complexity and machine creativity for [IEEE's 2021 Conference on Games](https://ieee-cog.org/2021/). Called [Carle's Game](https:/github.com/rivesunder/carles_game), it's based on a Life-like Cellular Automata Reinforcement Learning Environment. The challenge is to develop machine agents that can surprise us in one or more complex cellular automaton universes. It's a significant challenge for an agent to learn in an environment where the rules are simple (but the physics are complex) and there is no intrinsic reward (although there are 5 different reward wrappers to choose from to get started). I've made several example submissions to get you started: a direct optimization of patterns producing gliders/spaceships using a [covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy](https:/github.com/rivesunder/moving_in_morley), and an [interesting reward hack](https://github.com/rivesunder/harli_learning) discovered by a meta-learning Hebbian automaton agent that works in at least 5 different Life-like rule sets. You'll need to submit an entry by the end of July 2021 for a chance to win [a t-shirt](https://rivesunder.threadless.com/designs/puffer-progression), and you can do so by opening an Issue in the [carles_game](https:/github.com/rivesunder/carles_game) repository. I won't pull the wool over your eyes: it's a difficult challenge, and there's an intimidatingly expansive volume of possibility to explore, but I personally think you could contribute some really worthwhile ideas.

* [CARLE](https://github.com/rivesunder/carle)). CARLE stands for Cellular Automata Reinforcement Learning Environment and supports execution of arbitrary Life-like cellular automata rules (all 262,144 of them). With vectorization and acceleration on a single GPU, CARLE can execute more than 20,000 CA time steps per second. 

### Cask Storage
* [Bootstrapping Deep Neuroevolution and Developmental Learning](https://github.com/rivesunder/bevodevo). `bevodevo` is a resource for studying and experimenting with a range of evolutionary and developmental algorithms, currently with an emphasis on episodic reinforcement learning tasks but I hope to include ideas from open-endedness soon. 
* [Differentiable Cellular Automata](https://github.com/rivesunder/dca). `dca` is a project where I explore the confluence of ideas from differentiable programming, neural networks, and cellular automata, along the lines of Distill's thread on [Differentiable Self-Organizing Systems](https://distill.pub/2020/selforg/). 
* [DockRL](https://github.com/rivesunder/dockrl). Molecular docking wrapped in a reinforcement learning environment with optimization of the protein-ligand re-docking problem via covariant matrix adaptation evolution strategies. 
* [Policy Generating Evolved Networks](https://github.com/rivesunder/pgens). An approach to neuroevolution that evolves a meta-policy defining a distribution of policies for solving RL problems. Think evolved GANs for generating a diverse spectrum of policies based on fitness in a given RL environment.

### Writing 

<strong><!-- In addition to some commissioned writing assignments you may occasionally read on publications like Towards Data Science or KDNuggets, -->I have a few personal blogging projects:</strong>

* [theScinder](https://thescinder.com) ([Medium version](https://medium.com/the-scinder)). Essays of general interest on topics related to the practice and produce of science. Following feedback, I've been doing my best to make the articles on this blog more approachable and interesting for all levels of technical ability. I used to also describe my machine learning projects here, but I've since moved technical writeups to a dedicated blog.
* [RiveSunder Blog](https://rivesunder.gitlab.io). Writeups for some of my projects in machine learning. 
* [SortaSota](https://medium.com/sorta-sota). A blog where I try to explain things as simply as possible, but no simpler, mainly in tutorial format. In part I started this blog to give myself permission to teach skills and write about ML topics that are not necessarily at the cutting edge. It's state of _an_ art, just not state of _the_ art. 


### Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is probably via email. I use Protonmail and you can guess my address from my GitHub username. You can also find me
