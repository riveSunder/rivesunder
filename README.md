RiveSunder here. 

<strong>Projects I've been working on recently:</strong>

* [Bootstrapping Deep Neuroevolution and Developmental Learning](https://github.com/rivesunder/bevodevo)
* [Differentiable Cellular Automata](https://github.com/rivesunder/dca)
* [DockRL](https://github.com/rivesunder/dockrl)
* [Policy Generating Evolved Networks](https://github.com/rivesunder/pgens)

<strong>In addition to some commisioned writing you may see on publications like Towards Data Science or KDNuggets, I have a few personal blogging projects:</strong>

* [theScinder](https://thescinder.com)([Medium version](https://medium.com/the-scinder)). Essays of general interest on topics related to the practice and produce of science. Following feedback, I've been doing my best to make the articles on this blog more approachable and interesting for all levels of technical ability. I used to also describe my machine learning projects here, but I've since moved technical writeups to a dedicated blog.
* [RiveSunder Blog](https://rivesunder.gitlab.io)]. Writeups for some of my projects in machine learning. 
* [SortaSota](https://medium.com/sorta-sota). A blog where I try to explain things as simply as possible, but no simpler, mainly in tutorial format. In part I started this blog to give myself permission to teach skills and write about ML topics that are not necessarily novel. It's state of _an_ art, just not state of _the_ art.
